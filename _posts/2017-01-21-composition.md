{% contentfor intro %}
[Austin Hou](https://a.systems/) and I created a zine called "Com~~posit~~ion" for [Facebook Analog Lab's](https://www.facebook.com/analoglab/) Zine Fest. It challenges the rule of thirds by highlighting structural and psychological composition lines in Austin's travel photography.
