Venmo is a peer-to-peer mobile payments app that helps people send money instantly, for free.

<p>I worked on Venmo's small but mighty Product Design team during the summer of 2014. We focused on all things Android, iOS, and web. We built a slew of new features and reduced design debt, all the while rewriting how the design team itself operates. Among other projects, I designed the new compose screens (seen above) and the experience that integrates Venmo into <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com/v.zero">Braintree's v.zero</a> drop-in UI.</p>

Designing for Venmo included a lot of exploratory features. Below are some concepts that were never released, including Multipay, Undo, an alternative send command, and Material Design mockups that later inspired the Android update.
