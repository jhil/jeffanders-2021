{% contentfor intro %}
I worked with [Lan Xuezhao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xuezhao-lan-50aa1a1/) and [Kurt Varner](https://www.kurtvarner.com/) on branding BSV's $136M AI-focused venture capital fund. The final logo combines vector and building block imagery, reflecting mathematical concepts behind the namesake.
