### Imaginex is a creative technology studio that produces software systems for immersive, multi-sensory experiences.

I’ve had the pleasure of working with Eric Mintzer and the Imaginex team on a number of projects. Together, we’ve built an incredible brand, created exciting videos, and published slick websites for the company. The brand revolves around a Tron-inspired logotype stylized after `function(x)`. The "Creative Reality" tagline I wrote promotes the idea that Imaginex is not limited by the traditional constraints of our physical world.
