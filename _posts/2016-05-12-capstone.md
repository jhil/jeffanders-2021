For my Individual Studies major in Product Design & Engineering, I was required to create a capstone project. I called mine "Design For All." What follows is some of the writing and visuals I made to communicate my capstone research.

### Learning product design principles from different backgrounds

My major investigates how to create innovative products to solve human needs while also fostering the ability to build them. I am shifting from physical product design in my studies to digital design in my career. This project investigates how best to introduce universal product design concepts to people in tangential fields.

I led a series of design workshops targeted at people of different communities and diverse backgrounds. Then, I interviewed participants to understand how they learned new design principles.
