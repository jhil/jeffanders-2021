Open Ipsum is an app for creating and sharing lorem ipsum generators. It allows anyone to create, share, and collect ipsum generators from any set of strings with some intelligent Markov magic in the backend. I collaborated with Jackson Geller on this side-project, revived from its conception back in 2013.
