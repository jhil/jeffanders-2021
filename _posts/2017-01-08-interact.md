Interact is a community of technologists dedicated to social progress. Mackenzie Burnett, Maran Nelson, and Gwen Brinsmead approached me and Amritha Jayanti to rebrand the organization.

We explored dozens of design directions before landing on the final mark. It represents two central themes:

- Interact fellows display intentional impact. The line following the wordmark represents that participants are able to see what's next.

- The value that fellows get from Interact comes after the annual retreat when they can lean on the community for support and growth.

I made supplemental animations and web styles that inspired the final website, which was eventually designed and built by Gwen, Evan Pun, and Dan Schlosser.
