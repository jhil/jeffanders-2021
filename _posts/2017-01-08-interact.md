{% contentfor intro %}
Interact is a community of mission-oriented technologists, of which I'm a fellow. Mackenzie Burnett, Maran Nelson, and Gwen Brinsmead approached me and Amritha Jayanti to rebrand the organization. I made animations, web styles, and a member portal product with collaborators Dara Oke, Evan Pun, and Dan Schlosser. I then served for several years as Interact's Design Lead.

The final brand represents two central themes:
- Interact fellows display intentional impact. The line following the wordmark represents that participants are able to see what's next.
- The value that fellows get from Interact comes after the annual retreat when they can lean on the community for support and growth.
