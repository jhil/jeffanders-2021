[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/68ae56f0-82a5-4171-94a9-a37579a66a92/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/jhilco-2021/deploys)

## Setup

Install [yarn][yarn-install]. Then, install gulp:

```bash
yarn global add gulp  # May require `sudo`
```

Finally, install [ImageMagick][imagemagick]. You have done so successfully if you can run 

```bash
convert -help
```

without any errors.

## Usage

### Developing

```bash
yarn                   # One time
bundle install         # One time
gulp serve
```

### A Note on Directory Structure and Compilation

Because Gulp and Jekyll to not play nice historically, static assets need to be generated into two different folders:

* SCSS source files live in `_scss/` and compile to both  `css/` and `_site/css/` 
* JavaScript source files live in `_js/` and compile to both  `js/` and `_site/js/`
* Images in `_img/` compile to both  `img/` and `_site/img/`

> **Note:** the root level `css/`, `js/`, and `img/` folders are in the `.gitignore` and are regularly deleted.  **Modifications to these folders may be lost without warning!** Instead, edit source files in the corresponding underscore-prefixed folders.

### Responsive Images

This workflow allows you to use progressive, responsive images with ease. This means that with a single line of code, you can include an image that both loads with a blur-into-focus placeholder and loads an appropriately sized image for your device.

#### Instructions

1.  Place images that you wish to resize into the `/_img/res/raw` folder.
2.  To resize them, run

    ```bash
    gulp responsive
    ```

    > This will create subdirectories within the `/_img/res/` folder with resized images in each.  By default, it creates the folders `20/`, `400/`, `800/`, and `1600/`, with images resized to those heights in pixels in each one. Then, these images will be copied into `/_site/img/res/<size>` for static access. In addition, data about these images (filename / aspect ratio pairs, and generated sizes) is generated into `/_data/responsiveMetatdata.json`.

3.  Use the Jeyll include to insert your image!

    ```html
    {% include resimg.html src="example-image.jpg" %}
    ```
    
4.  (Optional) Use the included image viewer by adding the class `with-viewer`:

    ```html
    {% include resimg.html src="example-image.jpg" class="with-viewer" %}
    ```

5.  (Optional) Customize what size images are generated by changing the `responsiveSizes` variable at the top of `Gulpfile.js`.

> **Note:** By default, responsive resizing is not included in the `gulp serve` command, as it can be very computationally expensive. This can be enabled by uncommenting `['responsive']` in the `images` and `images:optimized` tasks.

> **Note:** By default, generated images and `/_data/responsiveMetadata.json` are included in the `.gitignore`.

## Reminders

If you want to use this repo for your next project, make sure to make the following changes:

1. Edit `_config.yml`, filling in the HTML metadata associated with your site.
2. Edit `package.json` providing a `name`, `version`, `description`, `license`, and `repository.url`.
3. Remove the `.git` folder, so that you start from a fresh commit history.
4. Edit `LICENSE.md` and `README.md` to your preference.
5. Remove `.gitkeep` files that are placeholders for your content.

## Gulp Commands

An overview of Gulp commands available:

### `gulp build`

Builds the site into the `dist` directory.  This includes:

- SCSS w/ linting, sourcemaps and autoprefixing
- JS linting and uglification
- Image optimization and resizing

### `gulp build:optimized`

This is used for distributing an optimized version of the site (for deployment).  It includes everything from `gulp build` as well as:
- SCSS minification
- CSS / JS inline-sourcing 
- more rigorous image optimization

### `gulp responsive`

Resizes images in the `_img/res/raw` directory into `_img/res/<size>` directories, for several different heights in pixels (default: 20, 400, 800, 1600).

### `gulp watch`

Watchs for changes in local files and rebuilds parts of the site as necessary, into the `dist` directory.

### `gulp serve`

Runs `gulp watch` in the background, and serves the `dist` directory at `localhost:3000` with automatic reloading using [Browsersync][browsersync].
